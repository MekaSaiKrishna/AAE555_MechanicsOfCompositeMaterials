# AAE555: Mechanics Of Composite Materials

> Course taught by Professor. Wenbin Yu, Spring 2024

**Description**: This course provides students a background in modern composite materials which are being used in an ever-increasing range of applications and industries. Basic knowledge of composite materials will allow engineers to understand the issues associated with using these materials, as well as gain insight into how their usage differs from conventional materials such as metals, and ultimately be able to use composites to their fullest potential. Topics covered include: current and potential applications of composite materials, fibers, matrices, manufacturing methods for composites, anisotropic elasticity, micromechanics for determining mechanical properties of composite materials, classical laminated plate theory, failure and strength analysis of composite materials, and other advanced topics related to mechanics of composite materials.
